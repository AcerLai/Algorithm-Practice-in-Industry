        "summary": "The rise of machine learning (ML) systems has exacerbated their carbon\nfootprint due to increased capabilities and model sizes. However, there is\nscarce knowledge on how the carbon footprint of ML models is actually measured,\nreported, and evaluated. In light of this, the paper aims to analyze the\nmeasurement of the carbon footprint of 1,417 ML models and associated datasets\non Hugging Face, which is the most popular repository for pretrained ML models.\nThe goal is to provide insights and recommendations on how to report and\noptimize the carbon efficiency of ML models. The study includes the first\nrepository mining study on the Hugging Face Hub API on carbon emissions. This\nstudy seeks to answer two research questions: (1) how do ML model creators\nmeasure and report carbon emissions on Hugging Face Hub?, and (2) what aspects\nimpact the carbon emissions of training ML models? The study yielded several\nkey findings. These include a decreasing proportion of carbon\nemissions-reporting models, a slight decrease in reported carbon footprint on\nHugging Face over the past 2 years, and a continued dominance of NLP as the\nmain application domain. Furthermore, the study uncovers correlations between\ncarbon emissions and various attributes such as model size, dataset size, and\nML application domains. These results highlight the need for software\nmeasurements to improve energy reporting practices and promote carbon-efficient\nmodel development within the Hugging Face community. In response to this issue,\ntwo classifications are proposed: one for categorizing models based on their\ncarbon emission reporting practices and another for their carbon efficiency.\nThe aim of these classification proposals is to foster transparency and\nsustainable model development within the ML community.",

        "summary": "Recently, model-based retrieval has emerged as a new paradigm in text\nretrieval that discards the index in the traditional retrieval model and\ninstead memorizes the candidate corpora using model parameters. This design\nemploys a sequence-to-sequence paradigm to generate document identifiers, which\nenables the complete capture of the relevance between queries and documents and\nsimplifies the classic indexretrieval-rerank pipeline. Despite its attractive\nqualities, there remain several major challenges in model-based retrieval,\nincluding the discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning, and the\ndiscrepancy between training and inference. To deal with the above challenges,\nwe propose a novel two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME, which\nmakes two major technical contributions, including the utilization of tokenized\nURLs as identifiers and the design of a two-stage generation architecture. We\nalso propose a number of training strategies to deal with the training\ndifficulty as the corpus size increases.

        "summary": "People usually have different intents for choosing items, while their\npreferences under the same intent may also different. In traditional\ncollaborative filtering approaches, both intent and preference factors are\nusually entangled in the modeling process, which significantly limits the\nrobustness and interpretability of recommendation performances. For example,\nthe low-rating items are always treated as negative feedback while they\nactually could provide positive information about user intent. To this end, in\nthis paper, we propose a two-fold representation learning approach, namely\nDouble Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (DDCF), for personalized\nrecommendations. The first-level disentanglement is for separating the\ninfluence factors of intent and preference, while the second-level\ndisentanglement is performed to build independent sparse preference\nrepresentations under individual intent with limited computational complexity.\nSpecifically, we employ two variational autoencoder networks, intent\nrecognition network and preference decomposition network, to learn the intent\nand preference factors, respectively. In this way, the low-rating items will be\ntreated as positive samples for modeling intents while the negative samples for\nmodeling preferences. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets and four evaluation metrics clearly validate the effectiveness and the\ninterpretability of DDCF.",

        "summary": "Dense retrieval has shown promise in the first-stage retrieval process when\ntrained on in-domain labeled datasets. However, previous studies have found\nthat dense retrieval is hard to generalize to unseen domains due to its weak\nmodeling of domain-invariant and interpretable feature (i.e., matching signal\nbetween two texts, which is the essence of information retrieval). In this\npaper, we propose a novel method to improve the generalization of dense\nretrieval via capturing matching signal called BERM. Fully fine-grained\nexpression and query-oriented saliency are two properties of the matching\nsignal. Thus, in BERM, a single passage is segmented into multiple units and\ntwo unit-level requirements are proposed for representation as the constraint\nin training to obtain the effective matching signal. One is semantic unit\nbalance and the other is essential matching unit extractability. Unit-level\nview and balanced semantics make representation express the text in a\nfine-grained manner. Essential matching unit extractability makes passage\nrepresentation sensitive to the given query to extract the pure matching\ninformation from the passage containing complex context. Experiments on BEIR\nshow that our method can be effectively combined with different dense retrieval\ntraining methods (vanilla, hard negatives mining and knowledge distillation) to\nimprove its generalization ability without any additional inference overhead\nand target domain data.",

The\nkey idea of GNN-based recommender system is to recursively perform the message\npassing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded\nembeddings, relying on sufficient and high-quality training data. Since user\nbehavior data in practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits\nskewed distribution, some recommendation approaches, e.g., SGL and SimGCL,\nleverage self-supervised learning to improve user representations against the\nabove issues. Despite their effectiveness, however, they conduct\nself-supervised learning through creating contrastvie views, depending on the\nexploration of data augmentations with the problem of tedious trial-and-error\nselection of augmentation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive\nGraph Contrastive Learning (AdaptiveGCL) framework which conducts graph\ncontrastive learning with two adaptive contrastive view generators to better\nempower CF paradigm. Specifically, we use two trainable view generators, which\nare a graph generative model and a graph denoising model respectively, to\ncreate contrastive views. Two generators are able to create adaptive\ncontrastive views, addressing the problem of model collapse and achieving\nadaptive contrastive learning. With two adaptive contrasive views, more\nadditionally high-quality training signals will be introduced into the CF\nparadigm and help to alleviate the data sparsity and noise issues. Extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\nmodel over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further visual\nanalysis intuitively explains why our AdaptiveGCL outperforms existing\ncontrastive learning approaches based on selected data augmentation methods.",

However, existing TCF models\nprimarily focus on using small or medium-sized LMs. It remains uncertain what\nimpact replacing the item encoder with one of the largest and most powerful\nLMs, such as the 175-billion parameter GPT-3 model, would have on\nrecommendation performance. Can we expect unprecedented results? To this end,\nwe conduct an extensive series of experiments aimed at exploring the\nperformance limits of the TCF paradigm. Specifically, we increase the size of\nitem encoders from one hundred million to one hundred billion to reveal the\nscaling limits of the TCF paradigm. We then examine whether these extremely\nlarge LMs could enable a universal item representation for the recommendation\ntask. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the TCF paradigm utilizing the\nmost powerful LMs to the currently dominant ID embedding-based paradigm and\ninvestigate the transferability of this TCF paradigm. Finally, we compare TCF\nwith the recently popularized prompt-based recommendation using ChatGPT.

Additionally, the platform interacts\nwith the users to recommend new content, receive an evaluation, and ultimately\nprofit from the content, which can be modeled as a recommender system.\n  Our study aims to explore how the platform can jointly optimize the contract\nand recommender system to maximize the utility in an online learning fashion.\nWe primarily analyze and compare two families of contracts: return-based\ncontracts and feature-based contracts. Return-based contracts pay the content\ncreator a fraction of the reward the platform gains. In contrast, feature-based\ncontracts pay the content creator based on the quality or features of the\ncontent, regardless of the reward the platform receives. We show that under\nsmoothness assumptions, the joint optimization of return-based contracts and\nrecommendation policy provides a regret $\\Theta(T^{2/3})$.

However, there are many cases where the users want\nto find a relevant passage within a long document from a huge corpus, e.g.\nlegal cases, research papers, etc. In this scenario, the passage often provides\nlittle document context and thus challenges the current approaches to finding\nthe correct document and returning accurate results. To fill this gap, we\npropose and name this task Document-Aware Passage Retrieval (DAPR) and build a\nbenchmark including multiple datasets from various domains, covering both DAPR\nand whole-document retrieval. In experiments, we extend the state-of-the-art\nneural passage retrievers with document-level context via different approaches\nincluding prepending document summary, pooling over passage representations,\nand hybrid retrieval with BM25. The hybrid-retrieval systems, the overall best,\ncan only improve on the DAPR tasks marginally while significantly improving on\nthe document-retrieval tasks.

These methods work with Seq2Seq models, where\neach query can be directly mapped to the identifier of its relevant document.\nAs such, they are praised for merits like being end-to-end differentiable.\nHowever, auto-regressive search engines also confront challenges in retrieval\nquality, given the requirement for the exact generation of the document\nidentifier. That's to say, the targeted document will be missed from the\nretrieval result if a false prediction about its identifier is made in any step\nof the generation process. In this work, we propose a novel framework, namely\nAutoTSG (Auto-regressive Search Engine with Term-Set Generation), which is\nfeatured by 1) the unordered term-based document identifier and 2) the\nset-oriented generation pipeline. With AutoTSG, any permutation of the term-set\nidentifier will lead to the retrieval of the corresponding document, thus\nlargely relaxing the requirement of exact generation. Besides, the Seq2Seq\nmodel is enabled to flexibly explore the optimal permutation of the document\nidentifier for the presented query, which may further contribute to the\nretrieval quality.

Dynamic graph learning methods commonly suffer from\nthe catastrophic forgetting problem, where knowledge learned for previous\ngraphs is overwritten by updates for new graphs.

This effect prevents the\nGCN-based RS from making precise and fair recommendations, decreasing the\neffectiveness of recommender systems in the long run.\n  In this paper, we investigate how graph convolutions amplify the popularity\nbias in RS. Through theoretical analyses, we identify two fundamental factors:\n(1) with graph convolution (\\textit{i.e.,} neighborhood aggregation), popular\nitems exert larger influence than tail items on neighbor users, making the\nusers move towards popular items in the representation space; (2) after\nmultiple times of graph convolution, popular items would affect more high-order\nneighbors and become more influential. The two points make popular items get\ncloser to almost users and thus being recommended more frequently. To rectify\nthis, we propose to estimate the amplified effect of popular nodes on each\nnode's representation, and intervene the effect after each graph convolution.\nSpecifically, we adopt clustering to discover highly-influential nodes and\nestimate the amplification effect of each node, then remove the effect from the\nnode embeddings at each graph convolution layer.

Diversification in production systems includes three\ncomponents: identifying requests that will trigger diversification, ensuring\ndiverse content is retrieved from the large content corpus during the retrieval\nstage, and finally, balancing the diversity-utility trade-off in a\nself-adjusting manner in the ranking stage. Our approaches, which evolved from\nusing Strong-OR logical operator to bucketized retrieval at the retrieval stage\nand from greedy re-rankers to multi-objective optimization using determinantal\npoint processes for the ranking stage, balances diversity and utility while\nenabling fast iterations and scalable expansion to diversification over\nmultiple dimensions.

Their potential for deeper user\nunderstanding and improved personalized user experience on recommendation\nplatforms is, however, largely untapped. This paper aims to address this gap.\nRecommender systems today capture users' interests through encoding their\nhistorical activities on the platforms. The generated user representations are\nhard to examine or interpret. On the other hand, if we were to ask people about\ninterests they pursue in their life, they might talk about their hobbies, like\nI just started learning the ukulele, or their relaxation routines, e.g., I like\nto watch Saturday Night Live, or I want to plant a vertical garden. We argue,\nand demonstrate through extensive experiments, that LLMs as foundation models\ncan reason through user activities, and describe their interests in nuanced and\ninteresting ways, similar to how a human would.\n  We define interest journeys as the persistent and overarching user interests,\nin other words, the non-transient ones. These are the interests that we believe\nwill benefit most from the nuanced and personalized descriptions. We introduce\na framework in which we first perform personalized extraction of interest\njourneys, and then summarize the extracted journeys via LLMs, using techniques\nlike few-shot prompting, prompt-tuning and fine-tuning. Together, our results\nin prompting LLMs to name extracted user journeys in a large-scale industrial\nplatform demonstrate great potential of these models in providing deeper, more\ninterpretable, and controllable user understanding.

Besides the\nranking relevance to users, the exposure fairness to item providers has also\nbeen considered an important factor in ranking optimization. Many fair ranking\nalgorithms have been proposed to jointly optimize both ranking relevance and\nfairness. However, we find that most existing fair ranking methods adopt greedy\nalgorithms that only optimize rankings for the next immediate session or\nrequest. As shown in this paper, such a myopic paradigm could limit the upper\nbound of ranking optimization and lead to suboptimal performance in the long\nterm. To this end, we propose FARA, a novel Future-Aware Ranking Algorithm for\nranking relevance and fairness optimization. Instead of greedily optimizing\nrankings for the next immediate session, FARA plans ahead by jointly optimizing\nmultiple ranklists together and saving them for future sessions. Particularly,\nFARA first uses the Taylor expansion to investigate how future ranklists will\ninfluence the overall fairness of the system. Then, based on the analysis of\nthe Taylor expansion, FARA adopts a two-phase optimization algorithm where we\nfirst solve an optimal future exposure planning problem and then construct the\noptimal ranklists according to the optimal future exposure planning.\nTheoretically, we show that FARA is optimal for ranking relevance and fairness\njoint optimization.

Particularly because user behavior signals often have\nstrong correlations with the ranking objective and can only be collected on\nitems that have already been shown to users, directly using behavior signals in\nLTR could create an exploitation bias that hurts the system performance in the\nlong run.\n  To address the exploitation bias, we propose EBRank, an empirical Bayes-based\nuncertainty-aware ranking algorithm. Specifically, to overcome exploitation\nbias brought by behavior features in ranking models, EBRank uses a sole\nnon-behavior feature based prior model to get a prior estimation of relevance.\nIn the dynamic training and serving of ranking systems, EBRank uses the\nobserved user behaviors to update posterior relevance estimation instead of\nconcatenating behaviors as features in ranking models.
