        "summary": "The rise of machine learning (ML) systems has exacerbated their carbon\nfootprint due to increased capabilities and model sizes. However, there is\nscarce knowledge on how the carbon footprint of ML models is actually measured,\nreported, and evaluated. In light of this, the paper aims to analyze the\nmeasurement of the carbon footprint of 1,417 ML models and associated datasets\non Hugging Face, which is the most popular repository for pretrained ML models.\nThe goal is to provide insights and recommendations on how to report and\noptimize the carbon efficiency of ML models. The study includes the first\nrepository mining study on the Hugging Face Hub API on carbon emissions. This\nstudy seeks to answer two research questions: (1) how do ML model creators\nmeasure and report carbon emissions on Hugging Face Hub?, and (2) what aspects\nimpact the carbon emissions of training ML models? The study yielded several\nkey findings. These include a decreasing proportion of carbon\nemissions-reporting models, a slight decrease in reported carbon footprint on\nHugging Face over the past 2 years, and a continued dominance of NLP as the\nmain application domain. Furthermore, the study uncovers correlations between\ncarbon emissions and various attributes such as model size, dataset size, and\nML application domains. These results highlight the need for software\nmeasurements to improve energy reporting practices and promote carbon-efficient\nmodel development within the Hugging Face community. In response to this issue,\ntwo classifications are proposed: one for categorizing models based on their\ncarbon emission reporting practices and another for their carbon efficiency.\nThe aim of these classification proposals is to foster transparency and\nsustainable model development within the ML community.",

        "summary": "Recently, model-based retrieval has emerged as a new paradigm in text\nretrieval that discards the index in the traditional retrieval model and\ninstead memorizes the candidate corpora using model parameters. This design\nemploys a sequence-to-sequence paradigm to generate document identifiers, which\nenables the complete capture of the relevance between queries and documents and\nsimplifies the classic indexretrieval-rerank pipeline. Despite its attractive\nqualities, there remain several major challenges in model-based retrieval,\nincluding the discrepancy between pre-training and fine-tuning, and the\ndiscrepancy between training and inference. To deal with the above challenges,\nwe propose a novel two-stage model-based retrieval approach called TOME, which\nmakes two major technical contributions, including the utilization of tokenized\nURLs as identifiers and the design of a two-stage generation architecture. We\nalso propose a number of training strategies to deal with the training\ndifficulty as the corpus size increases.

        "summary": "People usually have different intents for choosing items, while their\npreferences under the same intent may also different. In traditional\ncollaborative filtering approaches, both intent and preference factors are\nusually entangled in the modeling process, which significantly limits the\nrobustness and interpretability of recommendation performances. For example,\nthe low-rating items are always treated as negative feedback while they\nactually could provide positive information about user intent. To this end, in\nthis paper, we propose a two-fold representation learning approach, namely\nDouble Disentangled Collaborative Filtering (DDCF), for personalized\nrecommendations. The first-level disentanglement is for separating the\ninfluence factors of intent and preference, while the second-level\ndisentanglement is performed to build independent sparse preference\nrepresentations under individual intent with limited computational complexity.\nSpecifically, we employ two variational autoencoder networks, intent\nrecognition network and preference decomposition network, to learn the intent\nand preference factors, respectively. In this way, the low-rating items will be\ntreated as positive samples for modeling intents while the negative samples for\nmodeling preferences. Finally, extensive experiments on three real-world\ndatasets and four evaluation metrics clearly validate the effectiveness and the\ninterpretability of DDCF.",

        "summary": "Dense retrieval has shown promise in the first-stage retrieval process when\ntrained on in-domain labeled datasets. However, previous studies have found\nthat dense retrieval is hard to generalize to unseen domains due to its weak\nmodeling of domain-invariant and interpretable feature (i.e., matching signal\nbetween two texts, which is the essence of information retrieval). In this\npaper, we propose a novel method to improve the generalization of dense\nretrieval via capturing matching signal called BERM. Fully fine-grained\nexpression and query-oriented saliency are two properties of the matching\nsignal. Thus, in BERM, a single passage is segmented into multiple units and\ntwo unit-level requirements are proposed for representation as the constraint\nin training to obtain the effective matching signal. One is semantic unit\nbalance and the other is essential matching unit extractability. Unit-level\nview and balanced semantics make representation express the text in a\nfine-grained manner. Essential matching unit extractability makes passage\nrepresentation sensitive to the given query to extract the pure matching\ninformation from the passage containing complex context. Experiments on BEIR\nshow that our method can be effectively combined with different dense retrieval\ntraining methods (vanilla, hard negatives mining and knowledge distillation) to\nimprove its generalization ability without any additional inference overhead\nand target domain data.",

The\nkey idea of GNN-based recommender system is to recursively perform the message\npassing along the user-item interaction edge for refining the encoded\nembeddings, relying on sufficient and high-quality training data. Since user\nbehavior data in practical recommendation scenarios is often noisy and exhibits\nskewed distribution, some recommendation approaches, e.g., SGL and SimGCL,\nleverage self-supervised learning to improve user representations against the\nabove issues. Despite their effectiveness, however, they conduct\nself-supervised learning through creating contrastvie views, depending on the\nexploration of data augmentations with the problem of tedious trial-and-error\nselection of augmentation methods. In this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive\nGraph Contrastive Learning (AdaptiveGCL) framework which conducts graph\ncontrastive learning with two adaptive contrastive view generators to better\nempower CF paradigm. Specifically, we use two trainable view generators, which\nare a graph generative model and a graph denoising model respectively, to\ncreate contrastive views. Two generators are able to create adaptive\ncontrastive views, addressing the problem of model collapse and achieving\nadaptive contrastive learning. With two adaptive contrasive views, more\nadditionally high-quality training signals will be introduced into the CF\nparadigm and help to alleviate the data sparsity and noise issues. Extensive\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\nmodel over various state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Further visual\nanalysis intuitively explains why our AdaptiveGCL outperforms existing\ncontrastive learning approaches based on selected data augmentation methods.",

However, existing TCF models\nprimarily focus on using small or medium-sized LMs. It remains uncertain what\nimpact replacing the item encoder with one of the largest and most powerful\nLMs, such as the 175-billion parameter GPT-3 model, would have on\nrecommendation performance. Can we expect unprecedented results? To this end,\nwe conduct an extensive series of experiments aimed at exploring the\nperformance limits of the TCF paradigm. Specifically, we increase the size of\nitem encoders from one hundred million to one hundred billion to reveal the\nscaling limits of the TCF paradigm. We then examine whether these extremely\nlarge LMs could enable a universal item representation for the recommendation\ntask. Furthermore, we compare the performance of the TCF paradigm utilizing the\nmost powerful LMs to the currently dominant ID embedding-based paradigm and\ninvestigate the transferability of this TCF paradigm. Finally, we compare TCF\nwith the recently popularized prompt-based recommendation using ChatGPT.

Additionally, the platform interacts\nwith the users to recommend new content, receive an evaluation, and ultimately\nprofit from the content, which can be modeled as a recommender system.\n  Our study aims to explore how the platform can jointly optimize the contract\nand recommender system to maximize the utility in an online learning fashion.\nWe primarily analyze and compare two families of contracts: return-based\ncontracts and feature-based contracts. Return-based contracts pay the content\ncreator a fraction of the reward the platform gains. In contrast, feature-based\ncontracts pay the content creator based on the quality or features of the\ncontent, regardless of the reward the platform receives. We show that under\nsmoothness assumptions, the joint optimization of return-based contracts and\nrecommendation policy provides a regret $\\Theta(T^{2/3})$.

However, there are many cases where the users want\nto find a relevant passage within a long document from a huge corpus, e.g.\nlegal cases, research papers, etc. In this scenario, the passage often provides\nlittle document context and thus challenges the current approaches to finding\nthe correct document and returning accurate results. To fill this gap, we\npropose and name this task Document-Aware Passage Retrieval (DAPR) and build a\nbenchmark including multiple datasets from various domains, covering both DAPR\nand whole-document retrieval. In experiments, we extend the state-of-the-art\nneural passage retrievers with document-level context via different approaches\nincluding prepending document summary, pooling over passage representations,\nand hybrid retrieval with BM25. The hybrid-retrieval systems, the overall best,\ncan only improve on the DAPR tasks marginally while significantly improving on\nthe document-retrieval tasks.

These methods work with Seq2Seq models, where\neach query can be directly mapped to the identifier of its relevant document.\nAs such, they are praised for merits like being end-to-end differentiable.\nHowever, auto-regressive search engines also confront challenges in retrieval\nquality, given the requirement for the exact generation of the document\nidentifier. That's to say, the targeted document will be missed from the\nretrieval result if a false prediction about its identifier is made in any step\nof the generation process. In this work, we propose a novel framework, namely\nAutoTSG (Auto-regressive Search Engine with Term-Set Generation), which is\nfeatured by 1) the unordered term-based document identifier and 2) the\nset-oriented generation pipeline. With AutoTSG, any permutation of the term-set\nidentifier will lead to the retrieval of the corresponding document, thus\nlargely relaxing the requirement of exact generation. Besides, the Seq2Seq\nmodel is enabled to flexibly explore the optimal permutation of the document\nidentifier for the presented query, which may further contribute to the\nretrieval quality.

Dynamic graph learning methods commonly suffer from\nthe catastrophic forgetting problem, where knowledge learned for previous\ngraphs is overwritten by updates for new graphs.

This effect prevents the\nGCN-based RS from making precise and fair recommendations, decreasing the\neffectiveness of recommender systems in the long run.\n  In this paper, we investigate how graph convolutions amplify the popularity\nbias in RS. Through theoretical analyses, we identify two fundamental factors:\n(1) with graph convolution (\\textit{i.e.,} neighborhood aggregation), popular\nitems exert larger influence than tail items on neighbor users, making the\nusers move towards popular items in the representation space; (2) after\nmultiple times of graph convolution, popular items would affect more high-order\nneighbors and become more influential. The two points make popular items get\ncloser to almost users and thus being recommended more frequently. To rectify\nthis, we propose to estimate the amplified effect of popular nodes on each\nnode's representation, and intervene the effect after each graph convolution.\nSpecifically, we adopt clustering to discover highly-influential nodes and\nestimate the amplification effect of each node, then remove the effect from the\nnode embeddings at each graph convolution layer.

Our approaches, which evolved from\nusing Strong-OR logical operator to bucketized retrieval at the retrieval stage\nand from greedy re-rankers to multi-objective optimization using determinantal\npoint processes for the ranking stage, balances diversity and utility while\nenabling fast iterations and scalable expansion to diversification over\nmultiple dimensions.

Their potential for deeper user\nunderstanding and improved personalized user experience on recommendation\nplatforms is, however, largely untapped. This paper aims to address this gap.\nRecommender systems today capture users' interests through encoding their\nhistorical activities on the platforms. The generated user representations are\nhard to examine or interpret. On the other hand, if we were to ask people about\ninterests they pursue in their life, they might talk about their hobbies, like\nI just started learning the ukulele, or their relaxation routines, e.g., I like\nto watch Saturday Night Live, or I want to plant a vertical garden. We argue,\nand demonstrate through extensive experiments, that LLMs as foundation models\ncan reason through user activities, and describe their interests in nuanced and\ninteresting ways, similar to how a human would.\n  We define interest journeys as the persistent and overarching user interests,\nin other words, the non-transient ones. These are the interests that we believe\nwill benefit most from the nuanced and personalized descriptions. We introduce\na framework in which we first perform personalized extraction of interest\njourneys, and then summarize the extracted journeys via LLMs, using techniques\nlike few-shot prompting, prompt-tuning and fine-tuning. Together, our results\nin prompting LLMs to name extracted user journeys in a large-scale industrial\nplatform demonstrate great potential of these models in providing deeper, more\ninterpretable, and controllable user understanding.

Many fair ranking\nalgorithms have been proposed to jointly optimize both ranking relevance and\nfairness. However, we find that most existing fair ranking methods adopt greedy\nalgorithms that only optimize rankings for the next immediate session or\nrequest. As shown in this paper, such a myopic paradigm could limit the upper\nbound of ranking optimization and lead to suboptimal performance in the long\nterm. To this end, we propose FARA, a novel Future-Aware Ranking Algorithm for\nranking relevance and fairness optimization. Instead of greedily optimizing\nrankings for the next immediate session, FARA plans ahead by jointly optimizing\nmultiple ranklists together and saving them for future sessions. Particularly,\nFARA first uses the Taylor expansion to investigate how future ranklists will\ninfluence the overall fairness of the system. Then, based on the analysis of\nthe Taylor expansion, FARA adopts a two-phase optimization algorithm where we\nfirst solve an optimal future exposure planning problem and then construct the\noptimal ranklists according to the optimal future exposure planning.\nTheoretically, we show that FARA is optimal for ranking relevance and fairness\njoint optimization.

        "summary": "Sketch-Based Image Retrieval (SBIR) is a crucial task in multimedia\nretrieval, where the goal is to retrieve a set of images that match a given\nsketch query. Researchers have already proposed several well-performing\nsolutions for this task, but most focus on enhancing embedding through\ndifferent approaches such as triplet loss, quadruplet loss, adding data\naugmentation, and using edge extraction. In this work, we tackle the problem\nfrom various angles. We start by examining the training data quality and show\nsome of its limitations. Then, we introduce a Relative Triplet Loss (RTL), an\nadapted triplet loss to overcome those limitations through loss weighting based\non anchors similarity. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that\nreplacing a triplet loss with RTL outperforms previous state-of-the-art without\nthe need for any data augmentation. In addition, we demonstrate why batch\nnormalization is more suited for SBIR embeddings than l2-normalization and show\nthat it improves significantly the performance of our models. We further\ninvestigate the capacity of models required for the photo and sketch domains\nand demonstrate that the photo encoder requires a higher capacity than the\nsketch encoder, which validates the hypothesis formulated in [34]. Then, we\npropose a straightforward approach to train small models, such as ShuffleNetv2\n[22] efficiently with a marginal loss of accuracy through knowledge\ndistillation. The same approach used with larger models enabled us to\noutperform previous state-of-the-art results and achieve a recall of 62.38% at\nk = 1 on The Sketchy Database [30].",

        "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated promising outcomes across\nvarious tasks, including node classification and link prediction. Despite their\nremarkable success in various high-impact applications, we have identified\nthree common pitfalls in message passing for link prediction. Particularly, in\nprevalent GNN frameworks (e.g., DGL and PyTorch-Geometric), the target edges\n(i.e., the edges being predicted) consistently exist as message passing edges\nin the graph during training. Consequently, this results in overfitting and\ndistribution shift, both of which adversely impact the generalizability to test\nthe target edges. Additionally, during test time, the failure to exclude the\ntest target edges leads to implicit test leakage caused by neighborhood\naggregation. In this paper, we analyze these three pitfalls and investigate the\nimpact of including or excluding target edges on the performance of nodes with\nvarying degrees during training and test phases. Our theoretical and empirical\nanalysis demonstrates that low-degree nodes are more susceptible to these\npitfalls. These pitfalls can have detrimental consequences when GNNs are\nimplemented in production systems. To systematically address these pitfalls, we\npropose SpotTarget, an effective and efficient GNN training framework. During\ntraining, SpotTarget leverages our insight regarding low-degree nodes and\nexcludes train target edges connected to at least one low-degree node. During\ntest time, it emulates real-world scenarios of GNN usage in production and\nexcludes all test target edges. Our experiments conducted on diverse real-world\ndatasets, demonstrate that SpotTarget significantly enhances GNNs, achieving up\nto a 15x increase in accuracy in sparse graphs. Furthermore, SpotTarget\nconsistently and dramatically improves the performance for low-degree nodes in\ndense graphs.",

The majority of\nobjective functions for neural models can be divided into metric learning and\nstatistical learning. Metric learning approaches require a pair mining strategy\nthat often lacks efficiency, while statistical learning approaches are not\ngenerating highly compact features due to their indirect feature optimization.\nTo this end, we propose a novel repeller-attractor loss that falls in the\nmetric learning paradigm, yet directly optimizes for the L2 metric without the\nneed of generating pairs. Our loss is formed of three components. One leading\nobjective ensures that the learned features are attracted to each designated\nlearnable class anchor. The second loss component regulates the anchors and\nforces them to be separable by a margin, while the third objective ensures that\nthe anchors do not collapse to zero. Furthermore, we develop a more efficient\ntwo-stage retrieval system by harnessing the learned class anchors during the\nfirst stage of the retrieval process, eliminating the need of comparing the\nquery with every image in the database. We establish a set of four datasets\n(CIFAR-100, Food-101, SVHN, and Tiny ImageNet) and evaluate the proposed\nobjective in the context of few-shot and full-set training on the CBIR task, by\nusing both convolutional and transformer architectures.

Recent studies on this problem focused\nonly on extremely small networks, hence the challenge remains on how to achieve\na scalable solution, applicable to networks with millions or billions of nodes.\nWe propose an approach that is based on learning node representations for fair\nspread from diffusion cascades, instead of the social connectivity s.t. we can\ndeal with very large graphs. We propose two data-driven approaches: (a)\nfairness-based participant sampling (FPS), and (b) fairness as context (FAC).\nSpread related user features, such as the probability of diffusing information\nto others, are derived from the historical information cascades, using a deep\nneural network.

In FPS, fairness and cascade length information\nare considered independently in the decision-making process, while FAC\nconsiders these information facets jointly and considers correlations between\nthem.

        "summary": "Generative information retrieval (IR) has experienced substantial growth\nacross multiple research communities (e.g., information retrieval, computer\nvision, natural language processing, and machine learning), and has been highly\nvisible in the popular press. Theoretical, empirical, and actual user-facing\nproducts have been released that retrieve documents (via generation) or\ndirectly generate answers given an input request. We would like to investigate\nwhether end-to-end generative models are just another trend or, as some claim,\na paradigm change for IR. This necessitates new metrics, theoretical grounding,\nevaluation methods, task definitions, models, user interfaces, etc. The goal of\nthis workshop (https://coda.io/@sigir/gen-ir) is to focus on previously\nexplored Generative IR techniques like document retrieval and direct Grounded\nAnswer Generation, while also offering a venue for the discussion and\nexploration of how Generative IR can be applied to new domains like\nrecommendation systems, summarization, etc. The format of the workshop is\ninteractive, including roundtable and keynote sessions and tends to avoid the\none-sided dialogue of a mini-conference.",

        "summary": "Middle training methods aim to bridge the gap between the Masked Language\nModel (MLM) pre-training and the final finetuning for retrieval. Recent models\nsuch as CoCondenser, RetroMAE, and LexMAE argue that the MLM task is not\nsufficient enough to pre-train a transformer network for retrieval and hence\npropose various tasks to do so. Intrigued by those novel methods, we noticed\nthat all these models used different finetuning protocols, making it hard to\nassess the benefits of middle training. We propose in this paper a benchmark of\nCoCondenser, RetroMAE, and LexMAE, under the same finetuning conditions. We\ncompare both dense and sparse approaches under various finetuning protocols and\nmiddle training on different collections (MS MARCO, Wikipedia or Tripclick). We\nuse additional middle training baselines, such as a standard MLM finetuning on\nthe retrieval collection, optionally augmented by a CLS predicting the passage\nterm frequency. For the sparse approach, our study reveals that there is almost\nno statistical difference between those methods: the more effective the\nfinetuning procedure is, the less difference there is between those models. For\nthe dense approach, RetroMAE using MS MARCO as middle-training collection shows\nexcellent results in almost all the settings. Finally, we show that middle\ntraining on the retrieval collection, thus adapting the language model to it,\nis a critical factor. Overall, a better experimental setup should be adopted to\nevaluate middle training methods. Code available at\nhttps://github.com/naver/splade/tree/benchmarch-SIGIR23",

With the growing concerns of algorithmic fairness, RSs are not only\nexpected to deliver high-quality personalized content, but are also demanded\nnot to discriminate against users based on their demographic information.\nHowever, existing RSs could capture undesirable correlations between sensitive\nfeatures and observed user behaviors, leading to biased recommendations. Most\nfair RSs tackle this problem by completely blocking the influences of sensitive\nfeatures on recommendations. But since sensitive features may also affect user\ninterests in a fair manner (e.g., race on culture-based preferences),\nindiscriminately eliminating all the influences of sensitive features\ninevitably degenerate the recommendations quality and necessary diversities. To\naddress this challenge, we propose a path-specific fair RS (PSF-RS) for\nrecommendations. Specifically, we summarize all fair and unfair correlations\nbetween sensitive features and observed ratings into two latent proxy\nmediators, where the concept of path-specific bias (PS-Bias) is defined based\non path-specific counterfactual inference. Inspired by Pearl's minimal change\nprinciple, we address the PS-Bias by minimally transforming the biased factual\nworld into a hypothetically fair world, where a fair RS model can be learned\naccordingly by solving a constrained optimization problem. For the technical\npart, we propose a feasible implementation of PSF-RS, i.e., PSF-VAE, with\nweakly-supervised variational inference, which robustly infers the latent\nmediators such that unfairness can be mitigated while necessary recommendation\ndiversities can be maximally preserved simultaneously.

In recent years, neural retrievers based on pre-trained\nlanguage models (PLM), such as dual-encoders, have achieved huge success. Yet,\nstudies have found that the performance of dual-encoders are often limited due\nto the neglecting of the interaction information between queries and candidate\npassages. Therefore, various interaction paradigms have been proposed to\nimprove the performance of vanilla dual-encoders. Particularly, recent\nstate-of-the-art methods often introduce late-interaction during the model\ninference process. However, such late-interaction based methods usually bring\nextensive computation and storage cost on large corpus. Despite their\neffectiveness, the concern of efficiency and space footprint is still an\nimportant factor that limits the application of interaction-based neural\nretrieval models. To tackle this issue, we incorporate implicit interaction\ninto dual-encoders, and propose I^3 retriever. In particular, our implicit\ninteraction paradigm leverages generated pseudo-queries to simulate\nquery-passage interaction, which jointly optimizes with query and passage\nencoders in an end-to-end manner. It can be fully pre-computed and cached, and\nits inference process only involves simple dot product operation of the query\nvector and passage vector, which makes it as efficient as the vanilla dual\nencoders. We conduct comprehensive experiments on MSMARCO and TREC2019 Deep\nLearning Datasets, demonstrating the I^3 retriever's superiority in terms of\nboth effectiveness and efficiency.

A common practice is to train a CTR model on advertisement\n(ad) impressions with user feedback.

Existing studies on SSB mainly employ sample re-weighting\ntechniques which suffer from high variance and poor model calibration.

To achieve this, there are four\nproperties that a watch time prediction framework should satisfy: first,\ndespite its continuous value, watch time is also an ordinal variable and the\nrelative ordering between its values reflects the differences in user\npreferences. Therefore the ordinal relations should be reflected in watch time\npredictions. Second, the conditional dependence between the video-watching\nbehaviors should be captured in the model. For instance, one has to watch half\nof the video before he/she finishes watching the whole video. Third, modeling\nwatch time with a point estimation ignores the fact that models might give\nresults with high uncertainty and this could cause bad cases in recommender\nsystems. Therefore the framework should be aware of prediction uncertainty.\nForth, the real-life recommender systems suffer from severe bias amplifications\nthus an estimation without bias amplification is expected. Therefore we propose\nTPM for watch time prediction. Specifically, the ordinal ranks of watch time\nare introduced into TPM and the problem is decomposed into a series of\nconditional dependent classification tasks which are organized into a tree\nstructure. The expectation of watch time can be generated by traversing the\ntree and the variance of watch time predictions is explicitly introduced into\nthe objective function as a measurement for uncertainty.

        "summary": "Conversational recommendation systems (CRS) effectively address information\nasymmetry by dynamically eliciting user preferences through multi-turn\ninteractions. Existing CRS widely assumes that users have clear preferences.\nUnder this assumption, the agent will completely trust the user feedback and\ntreat the accepted or rejected signals as strong indicators to filter items and\nreduce the candidate space, which may lead to the problem of over-filtering.\nHowever, in reality, users' preferences are often vague and volatile, with\nuncertainty about their desires and changing decisions during interactions.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a novel scenario called Vague Preference\nMulti-round Conversational Recommendation (VPMCR), which considers users' vague\nand volatile preferences in CRS.VPMCR employs a soft estimation mechanism to\nassign a non-zero confidence score for all candidate items to be displayed,\nnaturally avoiding the over-filtering problem. In the VPMCR setting, we\nintroduce an solution called Adaptive Vague Preference Policy Learning (AVPPL),\nwhich consists of two main components: Uncertainty-aware Soft Estimation (USE)\nand Uncertainty-aware Policy Learning (UPL). USE estimates the uncertainty of\nusers' vague feedback and captures their dynamic preferences using a\nchoice-based preferences extraction module and a time-aware decaying strategy.\nUPL leverages the preference distribution estimated by USE to guide the\nconversation and adapt to changes in users' preferences to make recommendations\nor ask for attributes.\n  Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the\nVPMCR scenario, highlighting its potential for practical applications and\nimproving the overall performance and applicability of CRS in real-world\nsettings, particularly for users with vague or dynamic preferences.",

Different from traditional recommendation, takeaway recommendation\nfaces two main challenges: (1) Dual Interaction-Aware Preference Modeling.\nTraditional recommendation commonly focuses on users' single preferences for\nitems while takeaway recommendation needs to comprehensively consider users'\ndual preferences for stores and foods. (2) Period-Varying Preference Modeling.\nConventional recommendation generally models continuous changes in users'\npreferences from a session-level or day-level perspective. However, in\npractical takeaway systems, users' preferences vary significantly during the\nmorning, noon, night, and late night periods of the day. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a Dual Period-Varying Preference modeling (DPVP) for\ntakeaway recommendation.

Moreover, to model various preferences in different time\nperiods of the day, we propose a time-based decomposition module as well as a\ntime-aware gating mechanism.

Critiquing is a well-known paradigm for CRS that allows users to\niteratively refine recommendations by providing feedback about attributes of\nrecommended items. While existing critiquing methodologies utilize direct\nattributes of items to address user requests such as 'I prefer Western movies',\nthe opportunity of incorporating richer contextual and side information about\nitems stored in Knowledge Graphs (KG) into the critiquing paradigm has been\noverlooked. Employing this substantial knowledge together with a\nwell-established reasoning methodology paves the way for critique-based\nrecommenders to allow for complex knowledge-based feedback (e.g., 'I like\nmovies featuring war side effects on veterans') which may arise in natural\nuser-system conversations. In this work, we aim to increase the flexibility of\ncritique-based recommendation by integrating KGs and propose a novel Bayesian\ninference framework that enables reasoning with relational knowledge-based\nfeedback. We study and formulate the framework considering a Gaussian\nlikelihood and evaluate it on two well-known recommendation datasets with KGs.\nOur evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in leveraging\nindirect KG-based feedback (i.e., preferred relational properties of items\nrather than preferred items themselves), often improving personalized\nrecommendations over a one-shot recommender by more than 15%. This work enables\na new paradigm for using rich knowledge content and reasoning over indirect\nevidence as a mechanism for critiquing interactions with CRS.",

        "summary": "Clustering remains an important and challenging task of grouping samples into\nclusters without manual annotations. Recent works have achieved excellent\nresults on small datasets by performing clustering on feature representations\nlearned from self-supervised learning. However, for datasets with a large\nnumber of clusters, such as ImageNet, current methods still can not achieve\nhigh clustering performance. In this paper, we propose Contrastive\nLearning-based Clustering (CLC), which uses contrastive learning to directly\nlearn cluster assignment. We decompose the representation into two parts: one\nencodes the categorical information under an equipartition constraint, and the\nother captures the instance-wise factors. We propose a contrastive loss using\nboth parts of the representation. We theoretically analyze the proposed\ncontrastive loss and reveal that CLC sets different weights for the negative\nsamples while learning cluster assignments. Further gradient analysis shows\nthat the larger weights tend to focus more on the hard negative samples.\nTherefore, the proposed loss has high expressiveness that enables us to\nefficiently learn cluster assignments. Experimental evaluation shows that CLC\nachieves overall state-of-the-art or highly competitive clustering performance\non multiple benchmark datasets. In particular, we achieve 53.4% accuracy on the\nfull ImageNet dataset and outperform existing methods by large margins (+\n10.2%).",

Unlike\nstandard recommender systems that suggest items to users, reciprocal\nrecommender systems (RRSs) that suggest other users must take into account the\nmutual interests of users. In addition, ensuring that recommendation\nopportunities do not disproportionately favor popular users is essential for\nthe total number of matches and for fairness among users. Existing\nrecommendation methods in matching markets, however, face computational\nchallenges on large-scale platforms and depend on specific examination\nfunctions in the position-based model (PBM). In this paper, we introduce the\nreciprocal recommendation method based on the matching with transferable\nutility (TU matching) model in the context of ranking recommendations in\nmatching markets and propose a fast and examination-model-free algorithm.\nFurthermore, we evaluate our approach on experiments with synthetic data and\nreal-world data from an online dating platform in Japan.

However, the\nconventional learning paradigm of neural networks relies on iterative\ngradient-based updates with a small learning rate, making it slow for large\nrecommendation models to adapt.

Inspired by the\nslow-fast complementary learning system observed in human brains, we propose an\nerror memory module that directly stores error samples from incoming data\nstreams.

The framework\nalso supports scale-out by incorporating a hardware TCP/IP stack in the\naccelerator. \\textit{FANNS} attains up to 23.0$\\times$ and 37.2$\\times$ speedup\ncompared to FPGA and CPU baselines, respectively, and demonstrates superior\nscalability to GPUs, achieving 5.5$\\times$ and 7.6$\\times$ speedup in median\nand 95\\textsuperscript{th} percentile (P95) latency within an eight-accelerator\nconfiguration. The remarkable performance of \\textit{FANNS} lays a robust\ngroundwork for future FPGA integration in data centers and AI supercomputers.",

As directly optimizing\nuser retention is challenging, multiple evaluation metrics are often employed.\nExisting methods generally formulate the optimization of these evaluation\nmetrics as a multitask learning problem, but often overlook the fact that user\npreferences for different tasks are personalized and change over time.\nIdentifying and tracking the evolution of user preferences can lead to better\nuser retention. To address this issue, we introduce the concept of \"user\nlifecycle\", consisting of multiple stages characterized by users' varying\npreferences for different tasks. We propose a novel Stage-Adaptive Network\n(STAN) framework for modeling user lifecycle stages. STAN first identifies\nlatent user lifecycle stages based on learned user preferences, and then\nemploys the stage representation to enhance multi-task learning performance.\nOur experimental results using both public and industrial datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed model significantly improves multi-task prediction\nperformance compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the importance\nof considering user lifecycle stages in recommendation systems. Furthermore,\nonline A/B testing reveals that our model outperforms the existing model,\nachieving a significant improvement of 3.05% in staytime per user and 0.88% in\nCVR.

In principle, all the points on\nthe Pareto frontier are potential candidates to represent the best model\nselected with respect to the combination of two, or more, metrics.

The next item preference is\ntypically generated by the affinity between the sequence and item\nrepresentations. However, both sequence and item representations suffer from\nthe rank degeneration issue due to the data sparsity problem. The rank\ndegeneration issue significantly impairs the representations for SR. This\nmotivates us to measure how severe is the rank degeneration issue and alleviate\nthe sequence and item representation rank degeneration issues simultaneously\nfor SR.\n  In this work, we theoretically connect the sequence representation\ndegeneration issue with the item rank degeneration, particularly for short\nsequences and cold items. We also identify the connection between the fast\nsingular value decay phenomenon and the rank collapse issue in transformer\nsequence output and item embeddings. We propose the area under the singular\nvalue curve metric to evaluate the severity of the singular value decay\nphenomenon and use it as an indicator of rank degeneration. We further\nintroduce a novel singular spectrum smoothing regularization to alleviate the\nrank degeneration on both sequence and item sides, which is the Singular\nsPectrum sMoothing for sequential Recommendation (SPMRec). We also establish a\ncorrelation between the ranks of sequence and item embeddings and the rank of\nthe user-item preference prediction matrix, which can affect recommendation\ndiversity.

Existing RRS models mainly capture static user preferences, which\nhave neglected the evolving user tastes and the dynamic matching relation\nbetween the two parties. Although dynamic user modeling has been well-studied\nin sequential recommender systems, existing solutions are developed in a\nuser-oriented manner. Therefore, it is non-trivial to adapt sequential\nrecommendation algorithms to reciprocal recommendation. In this paper, we\nformulate RRS as a distinctive sequence matching task, and further propose a\nnew approach ReSeq for RRS, which is short for Reciprocal Sequential\nrecommendation. To capture dual-perspective matching, we propose to learn\nfine-grained sequence similarities by co-attention mechanism across different\ntime steps.

The detection of the underlying shopping\nintentions of users based on their historical interactions is a crucial aspect\nfor e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, to enhance the convenience and\nefficiency of their customers' shopping experiences.

        "summary": "Recommender system always suffers from various recommendation biases,\nseriously hindering its development. In this light, a series of debias methods\nhave been proposed in the recommender system, especially for two most common\nbiases, i.e., popularity bias and amplified subjective bias. However, exsisting\ndebias methods usually concentrate on correcting a single bias. Such\nsingle-functionality debiases neglect the bias-coupling issue in which the\nrecommended items are collectively attributed to multiple biases. Besides,\nprevious work cannot tackle the lacking supervised signals brought by sparse\ndata, yet which has become a commonplace in the recommender system. In this\nwork, we introduce a disentangled debias variational auto-encoder\nframework(DB-VAE) to address the single-functionality issue as well as a\ncounterfactual data enhancement method to mitigate the adverse effect due to\nthe data sparsity. In specific, DB-VAE first extracts two types of extreme\nitems only affected by a single bias based on the collier theory, which are\nrespectively employed to learn the latent representation of corresponding\nbiases, thereby realizing the bias decoupling. In this way, the exact unbiased\nuser representation can be learned by these decoupled bias representations.\nFurthermore, the data generation module employs Pearl's framework to produce\nmassive counterfactual data, making up the lacking supervised signals due to\nthe sparse data. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed model. Besides, the counterfactual data can\nfurther improve DB-VAE, especially on the dataset with low sparsity.",

        "pub_date": "2023-06-28",
        "summary": "Many hashing algorithms including minwise hashing (MinHash), one permutation\nhashing (OPH), and consistent weighted sampling (CWS) generate integers of $B$\nbits. With $k$ hashes for each data vector, the storage would be $B\\times k$\nbits; and when used for large-scale learning, the model size would be\n$2^B\\times k$, which can be expensive. A standard strategy is to use only the\nlowest $b$ bits out of the $B$ bits and somewhat increase $k$, the number of\nhashes. In this study, we propose to re-use the hashes by partitioning the $B$\nbits into $m$ chunks, e.g., $b\\times m =B$. Correspondingly, the model size\nbecomes $m\\times 2^b \\times k$, which can be substantially smaller than the\noriginal $2^B\\times k$.\n  Our theoretical analysis reveals that by partitioning the hash values into\n$m$ chunks, the accuracy would drop. In other words, using $m$ chunks of $B/m$\nbits would not be as accurate as directly using $B$ bits. This is due to the\ncorrelation from re-using the same hash. On the other hand, our analysis also\nshows that the accuracy would not drop much for (e.g.,) $m=2\\sim 4$. In some\nregions, Pb-Hash still works well even for $m$ much larger than 4. We expect\nPb-Hash would be a good addition to the family of hashing methods/applications\nand benefit industrial practitioners.\n  We verify the effectiveness of Pb-Hash in machine learning tasks, for linear\nSVM models as well as deep learning models. Since the hashed data are\nessentially categorical (ID) features, we follow the standard practice of using\nembedding tables for each hash. With Pb-Hash, we need to design an effective\nstrategy to combine $m$ embeddings. Our study provides an empirical evaluation\non four pooling schemes: concatenation, max pooling, mean pooling, and product\npooling. There is no definite answer which pooling would be always better and\nwe leave that for future study.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we consider the extent to which the transformer-based Dense\nPassage Retrieval (DPR) algorithm, developed by (Karpukhin et. al. 2020), can\nbe optimized without further pre-training. Our method involves two particular\ninsights: we apply the DPR context encoder at various phrase lengths (e.g.\none-sentence versus five-sentence segments), and we take a\nconfidence-calibrated ensemble prediction over all of these different\nsegmentations. This somewhat exhaustive approach achieves start-of-the-art\nresults on benchmark datasets such as Google NQ and SQuAD. We also apply our\nmethod to domain-specific datasets, and the results suggest how different\ngranularities are optimal for different domains",

        "pub_date": "2023-06-28",
        "summary": "Collaborative filtering (CF) is a widely employed technique that predicts\nuser preferences based on past interactions. Negative sampling plays a vital\nrole in training CF-based models with implicit feedback. In this paper, we\npropose a novel perspective based on the sampling area to revisit existing\nsampling methods. We point out that current sampling methods mainly focus on\nPoint-wise or Line-wise sampling, lacking flexibility and leaving a significant\nportion of the hard sampling area un-explored. To address this limitation, we\npropose Dimension Independent Mixup for Hard Negative Sampling (DINS), which is\nthe first Area-wise sampling method for training CF-based models. DINS\ncomprises three modules: Hard Boundary Definition, Dimension Independent Mixup,\nand Multi-hop Pooling. Experiments with real-world datasets on both matrix\nfactorization and graph-based models demonstrate that DINS outperforms other\nnegative sampling methods, establishing its effectiveness and superiority. Our\nwork contributes a new perspective, introduces Area-wise sampling, and presents\nDINS as a novel approach that achieves state-of-the-art performance for\nnegative sampling. Our implementations are available in PyTorch.",

        "pub_date": "2023-06-28",
        "summary": "Feature interactions can play a crucial role in recommendation systems as\nthey capture complex relationships between user preferences and item\ncharacteristics. Existing methods such as Deep &amp; Cross Network (DCNv2) may\nsuffer from high computational requirements due to their cross-layer\noperations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach called blockwise feature\ninteraction (BFI) to help alleviate this issue. By partitioning the feature\ninteraction process into smaller blocks, we can significantly reduce both the\nmemory footprint and the computational burden. Four variants (denoted by P, Q,\nT, S, respectively) of BFI have been developed and empirically compared. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms achieves close\naccuracy compared to the standard DCNv2, while greatly reducing the\ncomputational overhead and the number of parameters. This paper contributes to\nthe development of efficient recommendation systems by providing a practical\nsolution for improving feature interaction efficiency.",
